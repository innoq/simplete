# Simplete _/sɪmˈpliːt/_

Simplete ([demo](http://innoq.github.io/simplete/)) is a
[custom element](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction#custom-elements) for
autocompletion, using HTML fragments dynamically requested from the server. It
is suitable both for context completion and quicksearch results.

Simplete relies on established form semantics and leaves markup up to the
server. In contrast to most autocompletion libraries (see
[alternatives](#alternatives)), which typically rely on JSON responses and
client-side templating, this typically reduces complexity and increases
flexibility.

In addition to progressive enhancement, accessibility has been a major driver
in the design and implementation (largely thanks to
[Heydon Pickering](https://www.heydonworks.com)'s inspiring evangelism).


Usage
-----

```html
<form action="/search" method="get">
    <simplete-form action="/search/suggestions" method="get">
        <input type="search" name="query">
    </simplete-form>

    <button>search</button>
</form>
```

Typing into that search field will result in a form submission (i.e. a
`GET /search/suggestions?query=…` AJAX request). Typically the server would
respond with HTML like the following:

```html
<ol>
    <li>
        <input type="hidden" value="foo">
        lorem ipsum
    </li>
    <li>
        <input type="hidden" value="bar">
        dolor sit amet
    </li>
</ol>
```

Selecting an item from that list will populate the search field with the
corresponding value, which may subsequently be used to submit the surrounding
form. (Note that keyboard-based submission of the surrounding form is only
suppressed while navigating results.)

The server might also choose to respond with immediate results rather than query
suggestions:

```html
<ol>
    <li>
        <a href="http://example.org">example.org</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://example.com">example.com</a>
    </li>
</ol>
```

In fact, such HTML responses are not limited to any particular markup: The
server is free to include multiple lists, contextual feedback messages or
whatever seems appropriate (see (see [customization](#customization) below).

The `styles` directory contains some basic suggested CSS while `demo/demo.css`
contains a rudimentary theme.


### Customization

`<simplete-form>` may optionally be configured with the following attributes:

* `search-field-selector` (defaults to `"input[type=search]"`) is a selector
  identifying a search field (must be a unique child element)
* `query-delay` (defaults to `200`) is the number of milliseconds to wait before
  triggering an HTTP request
* `cors` is a boolean attribute which, if present, activates cross-origin
  requests

```html
<simplete-form search-field-selector="textarea" query-delay="100" cors>
    <textarea></textarea>

    <label>
        <input type="checkbox" name="case-sensitive" value="1">
        case-sensitive
    </label>
</simplete-form>
```

Similarly, server responses may optionally use attributes to identify content
elements via selectors:

* `data-item-selector` (defaults to `"li"`) identifies results
* `data-field-selector` (defaults to `"input[type=hidden]"`) identifies fields
  whose `value` will be used for populating the search field
* `data-result-selector` (defaults to `"a"`) identifies elements which represent
  immediate results

```html
<section data-item-selector="article h3"
        data-field-selector="button[type=button]"
        data-result-selector="button[type=submit]">
    <article>
        <h3>Hello World</h3>
        <p>lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</p>
        <button type="submit">upvote</button>
    </article>

    <article>
        <h3>…</h3>
        <p>…</p>
        <button type="submit">upvote</button>
    </article>
</simplete-form>
```


Dependencies
------------

Simplete has no external dependencies (though it includes a few tiny utility
functions from [uitil](https://github.com/FND/uitil)).

However, it does rely on modern browser features which might have to be
polyfilled:

* custom elements — suggested polyfill:
  [document-register-element](https://github.com/WebReflection/document-register-element)
* `fetch` — suggested polyfill: [whatwg-fetch](https://github.com/github/fetch)
  or [unfetch](https://github.com/developit/unfetch)
* `CustomEvent`
* `Element#closest`
* `Array#from`

The Financial Times's excellent
[polyfill service](https://github.com/Financial-Times/polyfill-service) is a
good source for additional polyfills.

The source code is written in ES2015, without relying on non-standardized
language extensions.
